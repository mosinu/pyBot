# pyBot
a few little bots I wrote in python. Some of them work, some of them don't. None of them are really useful but they did help with teaching my kids some programming.

# afk-bot
playing with pyautogui. wrote this to keep my IM from going idle by moving the mouse and typing on a note pad. Not really useful, just goofing with the api

# afk-bot2
same as the other but doesn't do the clicking or writing, just mouse movements and does a little more random movements

# twitterbot
playing with twitter api to like posts

# twitter-follow
follow people who follow me if they have a X number of users

# gamebot
simple game bot using pyautogi and pil to look for a pixel you feed it and click it

# simple-bot
a simple bot that sends a random phrase to an IM. I did not put in the ability to find the IM window, you have to do that yourself...maybe I will uptdate it to do that later. My wife hates this bot...
